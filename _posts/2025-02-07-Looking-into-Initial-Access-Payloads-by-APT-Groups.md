## Introduction

I recently started learning about maldoc analysis as part of my malware analysis journey. During this process, I explored different APT groups, including SideWinder( ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ ), Kimsuky ( ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡µ ) , and Gamaredon ( ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º ). I analyzed their samples, focusing on how they gain initial access. To conduct my research, I used platforms like VirusTotal, Twitter, and MalwareBazaar to find and study real-world malware samples.So, I am writing this blog which contains my findings for the same.

## Motivation

My motivation is to explore different areas of malware analysis and gain a deeper understanding of how cyber threats operate. By researching various APT groups, I can learn about different initial access techniques used by attackers. This helps in understanding the diverse ways cybercriminals infiltrate systems. The more APT groups I analyze, the better I can recognize attack patterns and improve threat detection skills. My goal is to continuously expand my knowledge in Malware Analysis and Threat Research.

## Technical Analysis

I wanted to learn about different APT groups and how they execute attacks in the initial phase. So, I collected three malware samples of different APT groups from MalwareBazaar and studied their initial attack methods.

Each group uses a different approach:

- SideWinder delivers a malicious document (Maldoc).
- Kimsuky uses a LNK file.
- Gamaredon deploys an HTA file.

Now, I will analyze these files to understand their attack techniques.

### Case 1 : Sidewinder using malicious document to drop RTF Payload.

During my analysis of an initial phishing attempt, I came across a document file. To examine its internal structure, I used the oleid command, which helped identify that the file contained an external relationship. This indicated that the document might be referencing or attempting to fetch external content.

To dig deeper, I used the `oleobj` command, which revealed that the document was configured to **download an RTF file from an external source**. The URL of this external file was embedded within the document, and the file being fetched was named **profile.rtf**. This suggests that the document was likely being used to execute a second-stage payload, making it a potential **malicious downloader**.

Then, after doing some research, I found that this is a **decoy RTF file**, while the actual **RTF payload** had already been removed from the **C2 server**.

For anyone interested in researching further on **how SideWinder targets victims or delivers the actual RTF payload**, you can refer to this [research](https://blog.strikeready.com/blog/rattling-the-cage-of-a-sidewinder/).
