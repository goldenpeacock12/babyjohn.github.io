## Introduction

I recently started learning about maldoc analysis as part of my malware analysis journey. During this process, I explored different APT groups, including SideWinder( ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ ), Kimsuky ( ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡µ ) , and Gamaredon ( ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º ). I analyzed their samples, focusing on how they gain initial access. To conduct my research, I used platforms like VirusTotal, Twitter, and MalwareBazaar to find and study real-world malware samples.So, I am writing this blog which contains my findings for the same.

## Motivation

My motivation is to explore different areas of malware analysis and gain a deeper understanding of how cyber threats operate. By researching various APT groups, I can learn about different initial access techniques used by attackers. This helps in understanding the diverse ways cybercriminals infiltrate systems. The more APT groups I analyze, the better I can recognize attack patterns and improve threat detection skills. My goal is to continuously expand my knowledge in Malware Analysis Threat Research.
